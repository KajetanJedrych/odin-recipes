    <h1>Spaghetti With Shrimps</h1>
    <img src="../img/instagram-In-Stream_Square___Shrimp-spaghetti-3.jpg">
    <h3>Garlic Shrimp Spaghetti is an easy and quick pasta dish for the weekday menu. Savory, succulent shrimp sizzling in a garlic butter sauce paired with light and airy spaghetti.
         Itâ€™s a family favorite that I can usually whip up in 15 minutes.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Shrimp: I recommend using good quality raw shrimp (fresh or frozen) for this recipe, as it is the main component of this dish.</li>
        <li>Pasta: any long pasta such as spaghetti, linguine, for fettuccine will work best for this recipe.</li>
        <li>Olive oil, garlic, butter, and crushed red pepper: to make the delicious garlic butter sauce.</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley: or basil to finish.</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese: for garnish. Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano will yield the best results, as it is adds a wonderful touch of umami (savory flavor) to the overall dish.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the shrimp with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta until it is one minute shy of al-dente. Reserve about a cup of pasta water and drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, melt 1 tbsp of butter in a skillet over medium heat and add the shrimp. Cook for about 2-3 minutes until they are just cooked through and opaque. Remove and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, melt 1 tbsp butter and mix in the olive oil. Add garlic, cook until the edges are lightly golden, and stir in the red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Add pasta and 1/2 cup of pasta water, and toss well to combine. Add shrimp, and season with salt to taste, while continuing to stir around the pan.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is tender and has aborbed most of the sauce, remove from heat and mix in the parsley. Garnish and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
